# Project Background and Content

In the digital age, people increasingly rely on screen devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers. This trend raises the risk of eye fatigue and vision problems. Therefore, it has become crucial to develop a quick and convenient vision detection system.

This project aims to utilize MediaPipe—an open-source framework developed by Google—to implement a real-time vision detection system. Through this system, users can easily perform vision checks and better understand their vision status.

## Project Goals

1. **Quick Detection**: Utilize advanced computer vision technology to achieve fast vision detection.
2. **Ease of Use**: Provide a simple user interface, allowing users to perform vision checks effortlessly.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Offer real-time analysis and feedback, helping users promptly understand their vision status.
